Hello everyone!

In this blog, we're going to discuss about sustainability, in depth into our previous sustainable project named The Foodbank Project and in detail what we've learned past 3 months on sustainability.

## What is Sustainability

Sustainability is a multifaceted concept that encompasses the aspiration to exist indefinitely without causing undue harm to future generations. It is intrinsically linked to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. Environmentally, sustainability involves actions like reducing carbon emissions, conserving resources, and promoting biodiversity. It encourages businesses to transition towards renewable energy sources and adopt circular economy principles. Socially, it emphasizes human rights, labor standards, and community development. Companies are expected to ensure fair labor practices, promote diversity and inclusion, and contribute positively to their communities. Governance relates to the ethical conduct of businesses, including transparency, accountability, and effective risk management. It requires companies to have robust governance structures that prevent corruption and protect shareholder rights. Together, these ESG actions form the backbone of sustainability, driving us towards a future where economic growth does not come at the expense of our planet or societal well-being.

Based on these facts, United Nation (UN) has listed goals called Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that everyone should take part.

## The Issue

Financial issues among students can significantly impact their daily food budgets. Rising tuition fees, accommodation costs, and other educational expenses often leave students with limited resources for their daily needs, including food. This financial strain can lead to food insecurity, where students may skip meals, opt for cheaper but less nutritious food options, or even go hungry. The situation is further exacerbated for those who are self-financing their education or come from low-income families. These financial constraints not only affect their physical health and well-being but can also impact their academic performance and mental health. Therefore, addressing student financial issues is crucial to ensure they have access to adequate and nutritious food and can focus on their studies without undue stress.

## The Foodbank Project

"The Foodbank Project" is a commendable initiative that was undertaken with the aim of addressing some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. Specifically, it focused on three key goals:

- **SDG 1: No Poverty**: The project aimed to alleviate poverty among students. With the escalating costs of education, many students find themselves in financially challenging situations. By providing food aid, the project sought to ease this financial burden and ensure that no student had to compromise on their basic needs due to monetary constraints.

- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**: A direct consequence of the project was its contribution towards achieving zero hunger. By setting up a food bank, the project ensured that students had access to food, thereby preventing hunger and promoting food security among the student population.

- **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**: Good health is intrinsically linked to nutrition. By ensuring access to food, the project indirectly contributed to the health and well-being of students. It recognized that a well-nourished student is more likely to be healthy, both physically and mentally, and therefore more capable of performing well in their studies.

The project, though small in scale, had a significant impact. It was specifically designed to cater to students, a demographic that often struggles with financial issues and may be at risk of food insecurity. The increasing fees and associated costs of education can put a strain on students, forcing them to cut down on essential expenses like food. This project aimed to combat this issue by addressing SDG 1: No Poverty, within the student community.

The success of the project was evident in the fact that the food collected was utilized by the students, indicating that there was indeed a need for such an initiative. This project serves as a testament to the fact that targeted, community-driven initiatives can have a profound impact on society and contribute significantly towards achieving the SDGs. It underscores the importance of collective action in the face of global challenges and highlights the role that each one of us can play in creating a more sustainable and equitable world.

## The Team

Our team of five people worked together to plan and execute a humanitarian project that aimed to provide food aid to those in need. It was a rewarding and enriching experience for us, as we had never done anything like this before. However, we also encountered many challenges along the way, such as managing the food stocks, securing the funds, and devising an effective promotion strategy to reach our target audience. We conducted surveys to evaluate the impact of our project and found that we had achieved some of our goals, but there was still room for improvement. We learned a lot from this project and we hope to continue our humanitarian efforts in the future.

## The Journey

The whole journey making this a reality was a whole new level of problems. From obtaining foods for the foodbank, decorating the booth/container and also promoting it in various student groups, truly makes it a wonderful journey.

I admit it was a rushed project, while we could planned it further and better, only these we were able to do with the time and financial constrains.

We've planned to make the project to be sustainable as possible, from using used wrapping paper, boxes and also collecting foods from people which helps reducing their extra foods to those needed more.

## Conclusion
This project is a learning opportunity for us, doing good for others to see and maybe might motivates people to continue giving others who need these better. I would like to thank my Professor which is Prof. Khalid in guiding us how to do things sustainably as possible. Without the knowledge, this project wouldn't be possible. Sustainable is not only on plants, but also in our daily life in doing things sustainable as possible.
